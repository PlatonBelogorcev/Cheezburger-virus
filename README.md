# Cheezburger-virus
This code creates an infinite loop that continuously creates text files with the name "fileX.txt" in a folder named "cheezburger" on the C drive. 
The content of each file is the phrase "Do you have any cheezburgers?" written on a new line.
It also starts the Notepad application and hides the console window while running.
Additionally, it turns off the monitor and deactivates input to the computer.
